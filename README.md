# First Milestone Project - The Band Website - Code Institute
This is my The Monkees band website built as my fiest milestone project. The main goal for it is to promote the band in the Internet. The website is targeted towards existing and potential fans and also the clients, who would like to book the band to play 
at their events. I was aiming to achieve clean and simple design and I wanted the website to be 'older user' friendly, so the more mature fans, that are not that familiar with the Internet were able to easily navigate and find the guidance (i.e. on how to 
download a song) as well as all the information they would require. I also wanted to achieve kind of a vintage look by using color palette that was typical for the 60s and 70s of the previous century and also a suitable typography.
The webpage was created using mobile first design approach. The layout changes depending on the device that it is being viewed on.
## UX
My first goal in the design of the webpage was to provide fans and potential clients with a webpage that is simple, but provides all the information and is easy to navigate. It was also important that the design is pleasing to the eye of the user.
User stories:
* As a potential fan I want to have an opportynity to obtain some information about the band history
* As a potential fan I want to have an opportunity to listen to some of the band's songs to see if this is the kind of music that I like
* As a fan I want to find an information regarding current and upcoming events, so I can go to a concert
* As a fan I want to find an information regarding any new songs, albums, so I can buy a newly release record
* As a fan I want to send a message to the band to express my gratitude for a good concert
* As a potential client, I want to be able to listen to some of the band's song, so I can base my decision whether I want to hire them or not
* As a potential client, I want to be able to contact the band to check if the are available to play at my event

## Features
The website consists of five sections:
* Fixed navigation bar, which allows to navigate thoughout the website, after clicking into different links. The bar remains on the top when the page is being scrolled. It collapses to 'hamburger menu' on smartphones. Underneath the navbar, there is an 
eye-catching background photograph with a greeting sign
* 'Who are we?' section which provides an information about the band and also some short bio notes of each band member.
* 'Music' section allows the user to listen to four songs (wchich can be downloaded as well) and to watch a video.
* 'The Monkees Live!' section provides an information about current and upcoming concerts. It also has a sub-section which contains feedback from fans that attended previous shows.
* 'Let's get in touch!' section allows users to contact the band, regarding availability to perform on different occasions. This section contains links to popular social media websites, which are currently being created

and using following browsers:
* Google Chrome (desktop version)
* Google Chrome (mobile version)
* Mozilla Firefox
* Mozilla Firefox Developer Edition
* Safari (iPad mini)
* Microsoft Edge
The site is working as intended, it is responsive and displays correctly on different sceen sizes, however an issue was noticed in Microsoft Edge. When trying to decrease the width of the website to mobile size, social media icons are floating to the 
left side of the form without any padding between them. This issue does not occur in any other browser.
