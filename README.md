# First Milestone Project - The Band Website - Code Institute


## UX
My first goal in the design of the webpage was to provide fans and potential clients with a webpage that is simple, but provides all the information and is easy to navigate. It was also important that the design is pleasing to the eye of the user.
User stories:
* As a potential fan I want to have an opportynity to obtain some information about the band history
* As a potential fan I want to have an opportunity to listen to some of the band's songs to see if this is the kind of music that I like
* As a fan I want to find an information regarding current and upcoming events, so I can go to a concert
* As a fan I want to find an information regarding any new songs, albums, so I can buy a newly release record
* As a fan I want to send a message to the band to express my gratitude for a good concert
* As a potential client, I want to be able to listen to some of the band's song, so I can base my decision whether I want to hire them or not
* As a potential client, I want to be able to contact the band to check if the are available to play at my event

## Features
The website consists of five sections:
* Fixed navigation bar, which allows to navigate thoughout the website, after clicking into different links. The bar remains on the top when the page is being scrolled. It collapses to 'hamburger menu' on smartphones. Underneath the navbar, there is an 
eye-catching background photograph with a greeting sign
* 'Who are we?' section which provides an information about the band and also some short bio notes of each band member.
* 'Music' section allows the user to listen to four songs (wchich can be downloaded as well) and to watch a video.
* 'The Monkees Live!' section provides an information about current and upcoming concerts. It also has a sub-section which contains feedback from fans that attended previous shows.
* 'Let's get in touch!' section allows users to contact the band, regarding availability to perform on different occasions. This section contains links to popular social media websites, which are currently being created
