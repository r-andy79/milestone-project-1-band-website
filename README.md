# First Milestone Project - The Band Website
Client - The Monkees band has requested to build a website to promote them in the internet. The goal for the website is to provide existing and potential fans with up-to-date informations regarding current events, such as concerts and any new material releases.
The website is targeted towards existing and potential fans and also the clients, who would like to book the band to play at their events.
The band requested for the website to be 'older user' friendly, so their mature fans that are not too familiar with the Internet were able to easily navigate and find the guidance (i.e. on how to download a song) and all the information they would require. 
The band wanted the website to have kind of a vintage look going back to the '60s and '70s of the previous century, wchich was accomplished by using suitable color palette and typography.
The website was created using mobile first design approach.

## UX

*As a potential fan I want to have an opportunity to listen to some of the band's songs to see if this is the kind of music that I like
*As a potential fan I want to have an opportynity to obtain some information about the band history..........
*As a fan I want to find an information regarding current and upcoming events, so I can go to a concert
*As a fan I want to find an information regarding any new songs, albums, so I can buy a newly release record
*As a client, I want to be able to listen to some of the band's song, so I can base my decision whether I would like to hire them or not

## Features
The website consists of five sections:
* Fixed navigation bar, which allows to navigate thoughout the website, after clicking into different links. The bar remains on the top when the page is being scrolled. It collapses to 'hamburger menu' on smaller devices. Underneath the navbar, there is an 
eye-catching background photograph with a greeting sign
* 'Who are we?' section which provides an information about the band and also some short bio notes for each band member.
* 'Music' section allows the user to listen to four songs and also to download them to any device and to watch a video.
* 'The Monkees Live!' section provides an information about current and upcoming concerts. It also has a sub-section which contains feedback from fans that attended previous shows.
* 'Let's get in touch!' section allows users to contact the band, regarding availability to perform on different occasions. This section contains links to popular social media websites...

## Testing
The website was tested in the following browsers:
*Google Chrome (desktop version)
*Google Chrome (mobile version)
*Mozilla Firefox
*Mozilla Firefox Developer Edition
*Safari (iPad mini)
*Microsoft Edge
It is working as intended, displaying correctly on different sceen sizes, however an issue was noticed in Microsoft Edge. When trying to decrease the width of the website, social media icons are floating to the left side of the form without any padding between them.
This issue does not occur in any other browser.


## Technologies used
Website was created using HTML, CSS and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) framework, which was used to create a responsive navigation bar. Flexbox layour was utilised to position biography notes and audio elements and make them responsive depending on the screen size.


## Deployment
This site is hosted on Github pages, deployed directly from the Master branch.
